# Fixes for Blank White Spaces on santrionline.com

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Loading State Performance

**Problem:** Loading skeleton displayed for 600ms causing perceived blank spaces
**Solution:** Reduced loading delay from 600ms to 200ms in `_index.tsx`

### 2. Image Loading Issues

**Problem:** Broken image URLs causing empty spaces where images should be
**Solution:**

- Added inline SVG placeholders for scholar and testimonial images
- Added background color fallbacks for lazy-loaded images
- Improved error handling with base64-encoded SVG placeholders

### 3. Layout Structure Issues

**Problem:** Missing container structure causing layout shifts
**Solution:**

- Added `page-container` and `content-wrapper` classes to `_index.tsx`

- Added proper background color to root layout

### 4. CSS Layout Stability

**Problem:** Layout jumping and undefined element sizes
**Solution:** Added CSS rules in `global.css`:

- Remove excessive margins between sections
- Add container layout stability with `contain: layout`
- Force proper image loading with background colors

### 5. Mobile Spacing Optimization

**Problem:** Excessive padding on mobile causing large blank areas
**Solution:** Added mobile-specific CSS overrides:

- Optimized hero section height (60vh on mobile vs 70-75vh on desktop)

**Solution:**

- Added `component-loading` class for minimum height during loading
